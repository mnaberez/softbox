
	CORVUS DISC ERROR CODES

THE CORVUS CONTROLLER HAS A NUMBER OF ERROR CODES
THAT MAY BE ISSUED IF EITHER  AN ILLEGAL COMMAND
IS GIVEN, OR THE CONTROLLER IS OUT OF SYNCHRONIZATION,
OR THERE IS A HARDWARE MALFUNCTION.  A NUMBER OF THE
UTILITIES AND DISC INTERFACE PROGRAMS CAN LIST THESE
ERROR CODES (IN HEX) IF SUCH AN ERROR OCCURES.  FOR
EXAMPLE,  PUTGET.COM  LIST THE CODE AS:

   ** DISC R/W ERROR # XXH **

WHERE XX IS THE ERROR CODE.  YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THIS
BY TRYING TO READ A SECTOR (WITH PUTGET) FROM DRIVE 4
(UNLESS YOU HAVE FOUR DRIVES).  THIS WILL GIVE ERROR
CODE: A7H.  THE UPPER 3 BITS OF THE ERROR CODE HAVE
THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANCE:

  BIT 5 :  SET IF THERE WAS A RECOVERABLE ERROR
	   (AS IN A RE-TRY ON READ OR WRITE).

  BIT 6 :  SET IF AN ERROR OCCURED ON A RE-READ
	   (VERIFICATION) FOLLOWING A DISC WRITE.

  BIT 7 :  SET IF ANY FATAL ERROR HAS OCCURED.
	   NOTE: MOST OF THE PROGRAMS WILL NOT
	   LIST THE ERROR UNLESS BIT 7 IS SET.

THE LOWER 5 BITS HAVE THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANCE:
