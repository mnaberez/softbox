	THIS FILE DOCUMENTS PROGRAMS CONTAINED ON THIS DISC

  1. INDEX.DOC
     THIS DISC INDEX DOCUMENT FILE.

  2. CERROR.DOC
     THIS IS A SHORT DOCUMENT FILE LISTING THE CONTROLLER
     ERROR CODES.

  3. PETGET.COM, PETGET.ASM
     THIS IS A NICE DISC UTILITY THAT CAN BE USED UNDER CP/M
     TO READ AND WRITE FROM MEMORY TO THE CORVUS DRIVE AS WELL
     AS FILL VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE DISC WITH DATA.  THE
     ROUTINE HAS ITS OWN DISC DRIVERS.


  4. DIAG.DOC, DIAG.COM, DIAG.ASM
     A RELATIVELY "SAFE" DISC DIAGNOSTIC THAT CAN BE USED
     TO VERIFY CORRECT DRIVE OPERATION AS WELL AS TO UPDATE
     THE CONTROLLER CODE AND CHANGE OTHER VARIOUS DRIVE
     PARAMETERS.  THIS NEW VERSION ALSO INCORPORATES ALL OF
     THE FEATURES OF THE FORMER CONTROLLER CODE UPDATE PROGRAM:
     CCODE.COM.


  5. MIRROR.COM, MIRROR.ASM
     THIS PROGRAM IS THE CONTROL PROGRAM FOR THE CORVUS "MIRROR"
     DISC BACKUP SYSTEM. IT WILL NOT WORK UNDER VERSION 0 OF
     THE CONTROLLER CODE.

  6. SEMA4.COM, SEMA4.ASM
     THIS IS AN EXAMPLE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ILLUSTRATE HOW
     TO ACCESS THE "SEMAPHORES" SUPPORTED ON THE CORVUS DRIVE.

NOTE1: THE SOURCES OF ALL PROGRAMS (EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL CONTROLLER
      CODE) ARE GIVEN BECAUSE:

      1. THEY OFTEN CONTAIN AN EXPLAINATION OF HOW TO USE THE
         PROGRAMS.
      2. YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE DISC I/O PORT ADDRESSES IF
         YOU HAVE A NON-STANDARD DRIVE INTERFACE.
      3. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO KEEP ANY BIG SECRETS FROM YOU.

      THE USE OF MOST OF THE UTILITY PROGRAMS IS EITHER
      FAIRLY OBVIOUS FROM THE PROMPTS, BY READING THE DOCUMENTATION
      OR BY SELF CONTAINED INSTRUCTIONS LISTED BY THE UTILITIES.

 NOTE2: ALL OF THE DISC UTILITIES CONTAIN THEIR OWN CORVUS
      DISC DRIVERS.  THEY CAN BE RUN FROM FLOPPY BASED CP/M
      SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT YET LINKED TO THE CORVUS DRIVE!!

 NOTE3:  SUPPORT FOR PRE-2.0 VERSIONS OF CP/M HAS BEEN
	DISCONTINUED ON THE 5MB DRIVE.

 Small Systems note : All ASM and COM files have been modified by us
 for the SoftBox.  The differences are :

	1.  DATA port is 18 hex instead of DE hex
	2.  STATUS port is 16 hex instead of DF hex
	3.  DRDY flag is 10 hex instead of 1 hex
	4.  DIFAC flag is 20 hex instead of 2 hex
	5.  DRDY is inverted - this mainly means that JNZ instructions
	    become JZ when looping on ready status.
