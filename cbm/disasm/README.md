# SoftBox Disassembly

This directory contains a disassembly of the original SoftBox
terminal program for Commodore PET/CBM computers.

## Files

 - `k.prg` is the original binary that was copied from a SoftBox boot disk.

 - `k.disasm` is a disassembly of `k.prg`.  It was first auto-generated by
   [CBMXfer](http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/software/cbmxfer/cbmxfer.html),
   then reverse engineered and commented.

 - `disasm2acme.rb` is a Ruby script that will convert the disassembly
   into [ACME](http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/)
   assembler format.

## Assemble

Convert `k.disasm` into ACME assembler source code:

    $ ruby disasm2acme.rb k.disasm > k2.asm

Assemble the source:

    $ acme -v1 --cpu 6502 --format cbm --outfile k2.prg k2.asm

The binary will be written to ``k2.prg``.  It should be identical to the
original ``k.prg``.
