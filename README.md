# SoftBox

This repository holds the reverse engineering effort for the
[SoftBox](http://mikenaberezny.com/hardware/pet-cbm/sse-softbox-z80-computer/),
a Z80-based single board computer for CP/M that attaches to
Commodore PET computers as an IEEE-488 peripheral.

## Files

 - `k.prg` is the original binary for the terminal program that
   that runs on the PET computer.

 - `k.asm` is a disassembly of `k.prg`.  It was first auto-generated by
   [CBMXfer](http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/software/cbmxfer/cbmxfer.html),
   then reverse engineered and heavily commented.
