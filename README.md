# SoftBox

This repository holds the reverse engineering effort for the
[SoftBox](http://mikenaberezny.com/hardware/pet-cbm/sse-softbox-z80-computer/),
a Z80-based single board computer for CP/M that attaches to
Commodore PET computers as an IEEE-488 peripheral.

## Files

 - `k.prg` is the original binary for the terminal program that
   that runs on the PET computer.

 - `k.disasm` is a disassembly of `k.prg`.  It was first auto-generated by
   [CBMXfer](http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/software/cbmxfer/cbmxfer.html),
   then reverse engineered and commented.

 - `disasm2acme.rb` is a Ruby script that will convert the disassembly
   into [ACME](http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/)
   assembler format.  The converted `k.asm` source will assemble a binary
   that is identical to the original `k.prg`.
